# Boxfunge

> Befunge interpreter in Rust

Boxfunge (oxidized Befunge) is an experimental interpreter for the esoteric [Befunge](https://catseye.tc/view/Befunge-93/doc/Befunge-93.markdown) programming language. Befunge is one of the most well-known esoteric programming languages and intended to be hard to compile. This is an *interpreter*, which simplifies the task, but it's still intended to be as fast as possible given that it's written in Rust.

Boxfunge targets Befunge-93, the original variant. However, it is planned to remove the 80x25 grid restriction via a command-line flag, which would allow the language to be Turing-complete. Support for Befunge-98 (a generalized extension with many advanced features like concurrency) may be added at some point.
